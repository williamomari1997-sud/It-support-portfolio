# Project 2: IT Service Desk Ticketing & Incident Management

## Objective
To demonstrate hands-on understanding of IT Service Desk operations using ITIL-aligned ticketing workflows similar to ServiceNow and Jira Service Management.

## Service Desk Concepts Used
- Incident Management (ITIL)
- Ticket lifecycle management
- SLA-based prioritization
- Impact vs Urgency assessment
- User communication and documentation
- First-line support resolution

## Ticket Lifecycle Workflow
1. Incident logged by end user
2. Categorization (Access, Hardware, Software, Network)
3. Impact & urgency assessment
4. Priority assignment (P1–P4)
5. Troubleshooting & resolution
6. User confirmation
7. Ticket closure with documentation
